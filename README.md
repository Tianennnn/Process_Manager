# Process Manager (PMan)

PMan is a simplified version of background process manager that supports executing processes in the backgroundâ€”that is, the process is running, but PMan continues to accept input from the user. PMan will contantly prompts <br />
```diff
PMan: >
```
for user input until "exit" is received and the process manager will exit. <br />

# Supported commands:
- **bg \<program\>:** PMan will start the program in the background. The program will execute and PMan will also continue to execute and give prompt to accept other commands. e.g., 
```diff
  PMan: >bg foo
``` 
- **bglist:** PMan will display a list of all the programs currently executing in the background. e.g., 
```diff
  PMan: >bglist
  123: /home/user/CSC/foo
  456: /home/user/CSC/foo
  Total background jobs: 2
```
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, there are 2 background jobs both running the program "foo", the first one has process ID 123 and the second one has 456.
    
- **bgkill \<pid\>:**  PMan will send the "terminate" signal to the job with the given process id, pid, to terminate that job. e.g., 
```diff
  PMan: >bgkill 345
```

- **bgstop \<pid\>:**  PMan will send the "stop" signal to the job with the given process id, pid, to stop (temporarily) that job. e.g., 
```diff
  PMan: >bgstop 345
```

- **bgstart \<pid\>:** PMan will send the "continue" signal to the job with the given process id, pid, to re-start that job. e.g., 
```dif
  PMan: >bgstart 345
```

- **pstat \<pid\>:**   PMan will list the following information related to given process id:

  - comm : The filename of the executable, in parentheses. 
  - state : One of the following characters, indicating process state: R (Running), S (Sleeping in an interruptible wait), D (Waiting in uninterruptible disk sleep), Z (Zombie), T (Stopped (on a signal) or (before Linux 2.6.33) trace stopped ), t (Tracing stop (Linux 2.6.33 onward)), W (Paging (only before Linux 2.6.0)), X (Dead (from Linux 2.6.0 onward)), x (Dead (Linux 2.6.33 to 3.13 only)), K (Wakekill (Linux 2.6.33 to 3.13 only)), W (Waking (Linux 2.6.33 to 3.13 only)), P (Parked (Linux 3.9 to 3.13 only)).
  - utime: Amount of time that this process has been scheduled in user mode.
  - stime: Amount of time that this process has been scheduled in kernel mode.
  - rss: Resident Set Size: number of pages the process has in real memory.
  - voluntary ctxt switches: Number of voluntary context switches (since Linux 2.6.23).
  -nonvoluntary ctxt switches: Number of involuntary context switches (since Linux 2.6.23).
    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, PMan supports these commands: **bg**, **bglist**, **bgkill**, **bgstop**, **bgstart**, and **pstat**. If the user types an unrecognized
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;command, an error message is given by PMan, e.g., 
```diff
  PMan:> ttest
  PMan:> ttest: command not found
```


# How to compile and run PMan:

There is a make file provided, so simply type "make" into the terminal to compile. <br />
Then type ./PMan into the terminal to execute PMan.
